BUGS

--------------

BUG01:

After minimizing and restoring the main window,
the option "Restore" still remains in sysmenu
though it has no use (BUG that is seen in many
Windows apps).

BUG02:

The requester for informing about invalid user
input should not be created by the MFC library
but by the program-code itself. The reasons are:

a) the MFC message is always in the language of
   the installed Windows version
b) the MFC does not check the values exactly enough;
   i.e. it does not complain about a 30.02.2003,
   which is wrong as February only has 28 days
   and 29 every 4 years (which should also be
   incorperated into the value check)

BUG03:

The URL referencing to the distribution site is
obsolete, home.germany.net/adi007 does not
exist anymore, it must be replaced by
home.arcor.de/adi007
